## Abstract

## Introduction

Although the AO classification is considered one of the main pillars behind the education of orthopedic residents, observer agreement has been reported to be poor in a number of previous publications (@andersen1996classification; @belloti2008distal; @kural2010evaluation; @kucuk2013reliability). Although well established, these findings are disconcerting as classifications are supposed to guide treatment indications, and a substantion lack of observer agreement might mean that a large percentage treatment variability might be explained by a simple lack of understanding of the fracture radiological appearance, biomechanics and, as a consequence, treatment. Despite our knowledge of the cognition behind medical diagnosis having substantially improved over the past couple decades, however, to our knowledge these fields have remained largely without an intersection.

* lit review on radius AO scale and lack of agreement (@andersen1996classification; @belloti2008distal; @kural2010evaluation; @kucuk2013reliability) 
* lit review on cognitive schema and medical diagnosis (@van2010cognitive; @ruiter2012achieve) 

The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the intra and interobserver reliability of the AO classification system for distal radius fractures with and without the aid of a cognitive schemata obtained through a cognitive task analysis.


## Methods


### Institutional Review Board

We obtained approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the São José Municipal Hospital prior to the initiation of this project (protocol number 1240.567) All participants were provided with informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.


### Participants

A total of 14 orthopedic residents participated in this study, 6 were first-year, 4 were second-year, and 4 were third-year residents. Their average age was <!-- number -->, 13 being males.<!-- Ricardo, precisa mesmo dessas informações. Não sei qual é a idade deles. --> <!-- sim, precisamos -->


### Image selection

Two second-year and one fourth-year residents that were not enrolled directly with the study and an orthopedic surgeon, specialist in hand selected 20 images containing fractures with a wide pattern variation chosen to cover the full spectrum of the AO classification for distal radius fractures. As imagens eram na incidência ântero-posterior e perfil. As imagens foram obtidas de arquivos dos Hospital São Municipal São José (Joinville – SC). Qualquer sinal de identicação de pacientes foi removido. Imagens radiográficas mal posicionadas que poderiam gerar problemas na interpretação foram excluídas. Imagens de baixa qualidade ou com artefatos ou outros defeitos técnicos também foram excluídas.


### AO classification


The AO classification is based on the degree of bone fracture, serving as the basis for both treatment indication and outcome assessment. <!-- ref -->
It divides fractures into three main categories: extra-articular, partial articular and complete articular. These three groups are organized in progressive order of severity in relation to their anatomical severity, treatment complexity and prognosis. Fractures from Group A (extra-articular) do not affect the radial-carpal join, while Group B (partial articular fracture) does affect the radio-carpal joint leaving a section of the articular surface remaining connected to the diaphysis. Fractures in Group C (complete articular fracture) constitutes a complete separation between the wrist joint and the dyaphysis. These three main groups are then subdivided into three subgroup, therefore constituting a total of 27 different types of fractures. These fractures vary in relation to how stable they are, their degree of comminution, how reduceable they are and the localization of their fragments (@graff1994fracture), https://www2.aofoundation.org/wps/portal/surgery?showPage=diagnosis&bone=Radius&segment=Distal )

### Situated schemata extraction using Cognitive Task Analysis

For the purposes of our paper, we define a situated schema as the collection of concepts and situations (e.g., narratives) that an expert hand surgeon relates to each classification category. In order to extract the situated schema from our expert hand surgeon (HA), we used the following sequence. 

First, the AO classification was presented to the hand surgery expert in an electronic format combining text and graphics for each classification category. Second, we asked the surgeon to "think aloud" about what they thought when finding a case in their daily practice. After an initial description, we specifically asked the expert to discuss any diagnostic, biomechanical or related therapeutic decision if it had not yet been previously mentioned. We also encouraged the expert to provide any narratives that might occur to him while thinking aloud about each classification category. The entire process was recorded in a video.

Second, the video was analyzed and a graph constituted by nodes and edges was built using [Graphviz](). Each node represented either a concept or a situation, while edges connected relationships among diagnostic, biomechanical and therapeutic nodes.



### Study logistics and procedures

#### Baseline evaluation
Inicialmente, cada residente independentemente classificou as 20 imagens de acordo com a Classificação AO. No dia do teste, cada residente recebeu o arquivo das imagens no seu notebook e assim que eles finalizavam a classificação de todas as imagens, esse arquivo foi apagado. As respostas eram anotadas em folhas impressas com a sequência das imagens. E em seguida as respostas foram transferidas a uma planilha do Excel. Os residentes podiam consultar na internet o sistema de classificação AO. Porém, não podiam conversar entre eles. Os autores do estudo não participaram como observadores.

#### Pre-intervention, thirty-day evaluation

Após 30 dias, cada residente recebeu um novo arquivo com as 20 imagens em uma ordem alterada. As respostas eram anotadas em folhas impressas e em seguida as respostas transferidas a planilha do Excel. Após finalizada a classificação das 20 imagens, já em seguida eles realizaram 30 exercícios no Concerto. E imediatamente após a realização dos exercícios as 20 imagens foram reclassificadas, dando aos residentes a oportunidade de mudar sua classificação. Assim que finalizaram a reclassificação das imagens o arquivo foi deletado de seus computadores. 



#### Intervention

Após esta primeira etapa inserimos 4 semanas de intervenção, ou seja, os residentes completavam online uma média de 15 exercícios por semana, relacionados ao diagnóstico, biomecânica e tratamento de fraturas de rádio distal na Plataforma Edx. Esses exercícios foram criados à partir de um esquema cognitivo obtido de um expert em ortopedia, especialista em mão. 


#### Post-intervention, sixty-day evaluation

After the 4-week intervention period, all participants classified the same 20 images following the same protocol.





### Outcome measurement

Intra-observer agreement was measured by comparing ratings by the same participant between baseline and the thirty 30-day assessment. Baseline inter-observer agreement was measured at the 30-day assessment. The pre-post intervention evaluation was conducted by comparing the 30-day pre-intervention assessment with the 60-day post-intervention assessment.


### Data analysis

All data were extracted directly from [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) databases connected to the [Open edX](http://code.edx.org/) platforms. Data sets were then merged, also undergoing an exploratory graphical analysis to verify distributions, percentages, means and frequencies/percentages as well as rates of missing data.
