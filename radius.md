## Abstract

<!-- write at the end -->

## Introduction

Although the AO classification is considered one of the main pillars behind the education of orthopedic residents, observer agreement has been reported to be poor in a number of previous publications. <!-- Ana, please add refs --> Although well established, these findings are disconcerting as classifications are supposed to guide treatment indications, and a substantion lack of observer agreement might mean that a large percentage treatment variability might be explained by a simple lack of understanding of the fracture radiological appearance, biomechanics and, as a consequence, treatment. Despite our knowledge of the cognition behind medical diagnosis having substantially improved over the past couple decades, however, to our knowledge these fields have remained largely without an intersection.

* lit review on radius AO scale and lack of agreement <!-- ana, please add ref -->
* lit review on cognitive schema and medical diagnosis <!-- ana, please add ref -->

The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of AO classification system for distal radius fractures with and without the aid of a cognitive schemata obtained through a cognitive task analysis.


## Methods



### Institutional Review Board

We obtained approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the São José Municipal Hospital prior to the initiation of this project <!-- Ana, please add number if available -->.  All participants were provided with informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.


### Participants

A total of <!-- number --> orthopedic residents participated in this study, <!-- number --> were second-year, and <!-- number --> were third-year residents. Their average age was <!-- number -->, <!-- number --> being males.


### Image selection:

We selected 20 images containing fractures with a wide pattern variation chosen to cover the full spectrum of the AO classification for distal radius fractures


### AO classification

<!-- Ana, please add a general description with links to the full classification -->


### Study logistics and procedures

Present a collection of 20 images. Each participant independently classifies the images according to the AO Classification. Afterwards, the answers are collected.
During the 30 days interval, the "expert" will be interviewed to explain how he thinks while classifies a fracture image. The AO Classification figures of different patterns of distal radius fractures will be shown to him. The interview will be recorded to allow represent their cognitive schemata. 
3a. Repeat the presentation of the same 20 images in 30 days.
3b. Immediate training (exercises)
3c. Repeat the presentation of the same 20 images again, giving the residents the opportunity to change their classification
